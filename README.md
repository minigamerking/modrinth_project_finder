# Modrinth Randomized Project Finder
I always had trouble finding mods that I never knew existed on modrinth and wanted to. I thought for a while and even made a request on modrinth for them to add a button like that on the website or app. I got a little bored one day and with the help of chatgpt for the css, I made this, a random project finder for modrinth

How it works is some pretty simple steps.
1. Press the filters you want to use
2. Press the get project button
3. Read whatever comes up

One thing to note though, it will be slower the more specific you want the mods. Just keep that in mind.
